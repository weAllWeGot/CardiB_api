# CardiB_api
an api to get a random BAR from cardi b's already impressive catalogue of quotables
Unfortunately azlyrics.com has some webcrawling blockers, so right now theres just a couple measly text files sitting on a server somewhere. But hopefully there are enough bars to get this off the ground.

# To Do
- Add more artists and have a 'POST' method that allows you specify artists
    - Or specify a genre
- Add deeper catalogue for each artist
