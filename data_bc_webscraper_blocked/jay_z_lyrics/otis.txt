I invented swag
Poppin bottles, puttin supermodels in the cab
Proof...
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublot's
Or the big face Roley, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes; go

Yeah, photo shoot fresh, lookin like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way I might murk ya
Flee in the G-450 I might surface
Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never goin to jail

Welcome to Havana
Smokin Cubanas with Castro in cabanas
Viva MÃ©xico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Drivin Benzes, with no benefits
Not bad, huh? For some immigrants
Build your fences, we diggin tunnels
Can't you see we gettin money up under you?
